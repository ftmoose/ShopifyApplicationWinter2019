!!! Intro paragraph goes here !!!

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of my project running on your local machine

### Prerequisites

For this to work you'll need to have the following installed:
* [NodeJS (npm)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - NPM is a package manager for NodeJS, it comes preinstalled with NodeJS
* [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) - No-SQL, document-oriented database program

### Installing
*Before starting make sure you have mongodb running on localhost.*

Start by cloning the repo into a directory of your choice

```
git clone https://github.com/rammom/ShopifyApplicationWinter2019.git
```

Move into the repository and install all dependencies

```
cd ShopifyApplicationWinter2019/app/
npm install
npm audit fix
```

Run the app

```
npm run dev
```

You can now find the app by going to localhost:8080
